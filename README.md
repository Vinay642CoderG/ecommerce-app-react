## Features

- **Product Listing**: Browse a list of products fetched from an external API.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product.
- **Cart Management**: Add products to the cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Fetch real-time product data from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable components, making development efficient and scalable.

- **React Router**: A library for managing navigation and routing in React applications. It allows users to move between different views (e.g., product listing, product details, cart) without reloading the page.

- **Styled Components**: A CSS-in-JS library that enables styling React components with scoped CSS. It ensures styles are encapsulated within components, avoiding global style conflicts.

- **Axios or Fetch API**: Tools for making HTTP requests to external APIs. These are used to fetch product data dynamically from APIs like [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

- **Redux (optional)**: A state management library for managing global application state. Useful for handling complex state interactions, such as cart management across multiple components.

- **Jest (optional)**: A JavaScript testing framework used for writing unit tests. It ensures that individual parts of the application work as expected.

- **ESLint (optional)**: A tool for identifying and fixing code quality issues. It enforces coding standards and helps maintain a clean codebase.

- **Babel (optional)**: A JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible versions for older browsers.

- **Vite.js**: A modern build tool for front-end development. It provides fast development server startup and optimized builds by bundling React.js code into efficient JavaScript files.
